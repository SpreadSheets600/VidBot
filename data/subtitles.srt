1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,587
Growing up my parents had

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,025
this insane rule If you

3
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,325
can reach it you clean

4
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,287
it thought it was the

5
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,362
dumbest thing ever

6
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:08,562
Like I'm supposed to dust

7
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:09,662
the top of the fridge

8
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:11,550
I can barely see up

9
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:11,937
there

10
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,562
Fast forward to adulthood and

11
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:15,650
I'm living with Chad

12
00:00:16,512 --> 00:00:17,912
Chad who thinks a dirty

13
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:19,600
dish magically teleports to the

14
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:20,350
dishwasher

15
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:22,687
One day I’m cleaning and

16
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,662
find a literal biohazard experiment

17
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:25,512
growing in the back of

18
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,200
the fridge

19
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:28,550
I unleash my inner child

20
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,137
climb onto the counter and

21
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,712
start scrubbing like my allowance

22
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:32,562
depends on it

23
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:34,900
Chad walks in sees me

24
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:37,150
precariously perched wielding a sponge

25
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,725
like a weapon and says

26
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:40,262
Whoa what are you doing

27
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,287
I yell down If you

28
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,537
can reach it you clean

29
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,300
it Chad

30
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:45,912
IT’S THE LAW

31
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:47,550
Then he looks at me

32
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:48,287
dumbfounded

33
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,225
He then asks why I’m

34
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:51,937
suddenly so clean oriented

35
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,562
I pause

36
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:55,337
Then I hear a voice

37
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,450
in my head because if

38
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:57,950
you can’t do chores what

39
00:00:57,962 --> 00:00:58,787
makes you think you can

40
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,137
do schoolwork and then the

41
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,075
video cuts
