Growing up, my parents had this insane rule: "If you can reach it, you clean it!" thought it was the dumbest thing ever. Like, I'm supposed to dust the top of the fridge? I can barely see up there! Fast forward to adulthood, and I'm living with Chad. Chad, who thinks a dirty dish magically teleports to the dishwasher. One day, I’m cleaning and find a literal biohazard experiment growing in the back of the fridge. I unleash my inner child, climb onto the counter, and start scrubbing like my allowance depends on it. Chad walks in, sees me precariously perched, wielding a sponge like a weapon, and says, "Whoa, what are you doing?" I yell down, “If you can reach it, you clean it, Chad! IT’S THE LAW!” Then he looks at me dumbfounded. He then asks why I’m suddenly so clean oriented. I pause. Then I hear a voice in my head “because if you can’t do chores, what makes you think you can do schoolwork?” and then the video cuts.
