Okay, so growing up, my mom had this rule: no yelling across the house. "Emergencies only!" she'd say. I thought it was the dumbest thing ever! Like, how else was I supposed to ask if we had any more dino nuggets?Fast forward to adulthood. I'm at my buddy Brian's for a BBQ. I'm in the kitchen, and he's...somewhere. Suddenly, a voice BOOMS, "HEY! YOU! HOT DOGS! HOW MANY?!"I nearly jumped out of my skin! I peek into the basement, and there's Brian, staring at me, waiting. I'm like, "Dude, I'm literally right here."Now, I get it, Mom. I totally get it. The yelling...the unnecessary decibels...it's pure chaos! So, now, my house rule? If you can't text it, walk it. Unless, of course, there are rogue squirrels in the attic. Then, all bets are off. AAAAHHHHH!
