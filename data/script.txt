Keys. Keys! Where are the KEYS?! Okay, picture this: little Timmy, always losing his keys. Dad's about to explode, veins popping, face redder than a firetruck. "TIMMY! IF I HAVE TO WAIT ONE MORE SECOND..." Cut to: Adult Timmy, now a zen master of key placement. Hook by the door? Mandatory. Guests lose keys? Instant side-eye. "Lost your keys, huh? You know what my dad used to say..." Dramatic flashback music. "BALLISTIC!" Now I'm my dad, but with better snacks. Keys on the hook, people. This is the way.
