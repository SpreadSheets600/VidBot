Speaker 1: My dad had this rule growing up, "If you open it, close it." Annoying, right? Like, I’m not a barn door!

Speaker 2: Oh, I had that rule, too! And "Put it back where you found it!" Like I'm some kind of museum curator!

Speaker 1: Seriously! But now? My roommate leaves cabinets open like we're living in a chaotic clown college! And I'm finding spatulas in the shower!

Speaker 2: Spatulas? Shower? Amateur hour! My partner once left the milk in the pantry. The MILK!

Speaker 1: Oh, the horror! It's like they're deliberately trying to summon the chaos gods!

Speaker 2: Exactly! Now I understand. My dad wasn't being a control freak. He was preventing the apocalypse, one cabinet door at a time.

Speaker 1: He was a hero! Underappreciated! We were fools! We didn’t understand the ancient wisdom!

Speaker 2: Now, if you'll excuse me, I hear a cabinet calling my name. And probably a rogue cheese grater in the bedroom. Gotta go!
