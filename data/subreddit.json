                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.  That would at least be the baloney sandwich of tipping.",

                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.

When I was in high school, we once arrived home to find all of our utilities shut off. We used the neighbors phone to call the utility companies and found out the bills weren't paid. My mother gave my brother the bills to put in the mailbox. We found months of bills under my brothers mattress. He put them there and forgot about it. Then I got stuck being the responsible one all the time. A blessing in disguise",

That was reserved for emergencies; if you needed to ask a question you get off your butt and go find the person you need to talk to. \n\nNow as an adult, when I'm at other people's homes and they are yelling from various rooms at each other it feels so aggressive, haha. If I'm asking you how many hotdogs you want on the BBQ for dinner I just go find you in the basement, I don't scream, \"BRIAN!!! HOW MANY HOT DOGS DO YOU WANT?? HOT DOGS. HOW MANY. DID YOU SAY THREE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU\"",

                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.

When I was in high school, we once arrived home to find all of our utilities shut off. We used the neighbors phone to call the utility companies and found out the bills weren't paid. My mother gave my brother the bills to put in the mailbox. We found months of bills under my brothers mattress. He put them there and forgot about it. Then I got stuck being the responsible one all the time. A blessing in disguise",

That was reserved for emergencies; if you needed to ask a question you get off your butt and go find the person you need to talk to. \n\nNow as an adult, when I'm at other people's homes and they are yelling from various rooms at each other it feels so aggressive, haha. If I'm asking you how many hotdogs you want on the BBQ for dinner I just go find you in the basement, I don't scream, \"BRIAN!!! HOW MANY HOT DOGS DO YOU WANT?? HOT DOGS. HOW MANY. DID YOU SAY THREE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU\"",

                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.

Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.

If I'm asking you how many hotdogs you want on the BBQ for dinner I just go find you in the basement, I don't scream, \"BRIAN!!! HOW MANY HOT DOGS DO YOU WANT?? HOT DOGS. HOW MANY. DID YOU SAY THREE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU\"",

Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.  That would at least be the baloney sandwich of tipping.",

Then tidying up her room. My kids put their dishes in the sink when they are finished as soon as they can reach - that\u2019s so they don\u2019t throw them and break something glass. We have them transport laundry to the washer. We also have them help with preparing meals whenever possible and especially when they show interest.\n\nWhen I was growing up, the rule was also \u201cwhen you can reach\u201d - when you\u2019re tall enough to press the buttons on the washing machine, that becomes your chore. When you\u2019re tall enough to lean over the sink and reach the water, you wash them/load the dishwasher. \n\nIt\u2019s always fascinating to me to see how much my kids want or know to do already just by observing us do it. They love to help sweep and have started to show interest in vacuuming. Just giving them the chance to hold things and praising them goes a long way. Then, once they show an interest in things at the store (\u201ccan I have that?\u201d, \u201ccan I have this for my birthday?\u201d), you can build in an allowance system. \n\nKudos to you for being willing to ask!!",

If I had a play or a game I wanted him to come to, I'd say it started 2-3 hours earlier than it actually did and he'd still miss most if not all of it. His band nickname was \"Tony Late\" because they'd wait and wait for him, finally start without their lead guitar and backup vocals only to have him jump on stage several songs in, plug in his guitar, and start playing like nothing happened. The longest he was ever late was over 24 hours, and that was with him constantly telling us he'd already left. He lived an hour away.",

Would have guessed he was a lawyer, if he was sitting ahead of the bar.\n\nHe stands up, and says out loud, \"Well, I have a driver's liscence with that name on it, but as its in capitals you can see that's the name of a corporation, your honour.\"\n\nThe justice on the bench did his best to be reasonable with this guy. But the guy immeadiatly starts a speech about how the system is corrupt and there needs to be changes. \nHe would go on about that several times in the next while.\n\nThis first time, the justice says, \"That's not what we are here to discuss today. We're here for a speeding ticket. And if *defendant's name* doesn't present himself in front of this bar, I'm ruling a conviction in absense.\"\n\nSo the defendant hustles in front of the bar (officially presenting himself for the case, behind the bar is gallery only) and proceeds to start an indignant series of acid born arguements that were so bizzare as to verge on schitzophrenia.\n\nHighlights were: \n\nTrying to invoke papal law. To which the justice responds, \"Papal law? This isn't rome, that doesn't apply here.\"\n\nDefendant tries to quote admiralty law, which perplexes the justice as, \"Where do you get admiralty law? This is Alberta, this is the most landlocked province in the country. Where do you get admiralty law?\"\nThe defendant replies, straight faced and serious, \"Well there used to be a fountain in the basement, sir.\"\n\nMind you, defendant hasn't even made his initial plea yet. Multiple times the justice tries to steer him back on track, and the guy keeps responding, \"Well, I did it, but that's not the point.\"\n\nSo well after a balif has been called to keep an eye on this thing, and I, witnessing this, have finally realized I wasn't dreaming, the justice on the bench finally says, \"Ok. Fine, you've said you've done it multiple times before, and I'll accept that as a guilty plea.\"  Hands out fine and thirty days to pay, next case.",

The supplier was adamant that they'd supplied as quoted, and that we'd need to pay far more if we wanted what we were asking for.\n\nIt literally got to the point where, new to the job, I'm in a meeting with the director of finance of my company (also my direct boss) on one side, and the CEO and finance officers of the supplier involved on the other side.  We're about to be threatened with court action for failing to pay, and we're about to claim they failed to deliver.  It's going to be real messy, and this is the final meeting before we hand it over to lawyers.\n\nThey present reams of evidence, emails, invoices, quotes, etc.  They argue, the director of finance gets really pissed with me that it's had to go this far, and after quite a while of back and forth and a lot of tension in the room, attention turns from both sides to me particularly.\n\nAnd I say:  \"We placed an order, for this kit as we specified, for which we were specifically quoted \u00a3X, which we then agreed to, and which your company accepted, but then did not deliver as specified\".\n\nThe supplier almost laughs at me.\n\n\"Can you prove that?!\"\n\n\"Yes, here is the email chain in question, each with the full headers detailing the time it was sent, received, who to and who by, with the unique Exchange email ID generated by your email servers, where it clearly states the specification that was agreed, a quote with the price for that specification (literally detailed in the quote too), my acceptance of it, and your agent's confirmation of such with an expected delivery date\".\n\nSomehow... it had got to that stage with them having NO RECORD of that email chain, half a dozen emails, from their own employee.  Only earlier quotes and specifications which were later corrected and not ordered until they were correct.  They'd delivered the earlier, incorrect, specification kit, which was missing huge chunks of very expensive and necessary hardware.  And they were trying to claim that we hadn't ordered them.\n\nAdditionally, the final price on the quote / purchase order, etc. was changed from the earlier specifications but only slightly - so it wasn't a copy/paste error, and it was a significantly brilliant deal for the hardware finally quoted for (or I wouldn't have used them!).  Someone their end obviously fucked up and rather than just say that (and we'd have probably just paid the difference at that point), they argued it and their employee had obviously realised, lied and tried to cover up the evidence.",

                                "body": "Even my boss just kept saying to me that he wasn't interested and believed I'd fucked up, even though I'd showed him those emails.  I think he just wanted me to take the fall because he thought I'd been the one to fuck up, and he didn't read what I was sending him (this was a common theme over the next 8 years of working there, and every time he fell face-first into the evidence of my emails, including one incident where he SCREAMED down a phone that he hadn't ever been notified of something I'd done, so as he was doing so I re-forwarded the email I'd sent him at the time stating exactly that, and his dismissive response to it).  He was basically arguing with the company, while thinking we were in the wrong, and wouldn't listen or even read our own evidence.\n\nBut their faces (of everyone) when I slid across the printed emails with full headers (and evidentially-rigorous original copies still on the servers) were a picture.  They literally stopped the meeting to phone back to their IT guys and were reading out the message ID to them over the phone.  Turns out, it was a genuine email chain.  Shocking that.  And did, in fact, prove that I'd ordered the kit as specified for the price specified and that they'd entered into a contract to supply that to me at that price, without any objection.\n\nTurns out, I managed to get the best deal ever on a whole raft of very expensive server kit, the missing pieces arrived the next day (at their cost), we terminated all business with that company, and yet my boss never learned the lesson that I keep everything in email for a reason.\n\nAlso fallen foul of this:  A car insurer that terminated my insurance retroactively (which is illegal anyway!) for \"failing to pay\" when my bank were quite surprised by such an assertion as the company had an automatic payment for the insurance under their own control.  This was after I produced a series of every mailed letter from them, still in original envelopes, still with the postmarks, still with the date and document number, including one that they had been claiming didn't exist. They later begged me not to report them to the authorities because they'd basically illegally cancelled my car insurance for non-payment when they'd written \"you are up-to-date on your payments and have nothing more to pay\" in a letter just the day before (and another letter 2 days later which told me they'd cancelled my policy 7 days prior, but was postmarked the day before and yet dated in the future), and for which if I'd been stopped or had an accident in those few days I would have been flagged as \"uninsured\" with serious consequences...\n\nA major mobile phone provider who refused to refund my money because they said I had been sent my new phone, which never arrived, and started taking monthly payments even after I reported it never having arrived and being lost in the post.  Whose only evidence that I ever signed a contract with them was... non-existent.  The contract to be signed was apparently in the lost parcel, too.  So they had no contract, hence no cause to take my money.  (And they'd sent the phone by unrecorded, uninsured, second-class standard post with no tracking so couldn't even prove they'd even sent it!).  They were quite surprised when I kept asking them to furnish me with a copy of this contract I'd allegedly signed that allowed them to keep stealing my money from my account and they were singularly unable to.\n\nAlways keep emails and written copies of everything.",

Mom, my client, wouldn't agree to a rather good settlement agreement and wanted her way 100%. She wanted a judge to decide rather than the parties settling where they both walk away winning and losing in a sense. The hearing starts, and the judge enters. We all rise like you typically do and the judge unleashes a tirade telling us to sit down, it's obvious we're from the big city all dressed up, but it's his courtroom and he's in charge. Then the judge mentioned his military service, and I knew that minute we weren't going to win this case. The dad was formal military. I pissed the judge off by not taking the time to know how he operates his courtroom before appearing in it. Judge ordered a dad favorable opinion. Mom was mad. I learned two valuable lessons. The first is that settlement is preferred because you at least have some control over the outcome. And the second is get to know the court you are in.\n\nEdit: Most civil court cases are legally nearly 50/50. Both parties have legal standing to present their version of events and proposed remedies based on legally sound arguments. There's only a cunt hair of legal difference between the two sides. Having a professional relationship with the judge (and county bar association) can be the difference between winning and losing a case. If there's not much to go on. The judge is going to side with the one person they know because it becomes about character and trusting a lawyer's candor at that point. It's just a reality.",

My job is to resolve tax disputes before trial, and if they go to trial, I am the State's primary witness.\n\nThis means I'm subject to cross examination by the other side (typically the taxpayer).\n\nI was dealing with a difficult [agitated/aggressive] taxpayer for an extended period of time.  This is common before trial - we try not to go to trial, so there was a prolonged period of me trying to explain why we did what we did.  I had some brutal trial prep with our attorneys to get me ready for anticipated cross examination.\n\nTo reiterate, I work for the state equivalent of the IRS, the IRS being a federal agency.  I gave my testimony.  Then the taxpayer was allowed to cross examine me.\n\nHe asked me \"why the IRS disallowed his refund.\"\n\nI explained [for about the fifth time] I do not work for the IRS, and I do not know why the IRS did what they did.  He would need to ask the IRS.\n\nI was tempted to comment that if the IRS also disallowed his refund, it would appear the state-side adjustment was also correct, since we follow federal law.  I decided against it.\n\nNext he said, \"No further questions.\"\n\nGoing to trial is expensive.  Both sides had to split the costs for the court stenographer ($1,400, so $700 each).\n\nDuring the lead-up to the trial, I told him multiple times **we are not the IRS**.\n\nDude literally paid $700 to ask me under oath if I worked for the IRS; because apparently my telling him multiple times that I do not (and all of our correspondences being on my State's letterhead) was not good enough for him.  I think he may have had some brutal follow-up questions for the IRS, and he was completely blindsided by this revelation?  IDK.  The amount at issue was about $3,000; so $700 was a hefty amount for the taxpayer.\n\nOf course he lost.  We knew we were probably going to win before trial, but when he declined to even ask me any questions which could advance his case, it was clearly over.\n\nEdit: minor grammar",

At her original bond hearing, when told she would have to do a drug test upon release, she admitted to marijuana use that might show up on the test, but was ultimately granted bond and given 7 days to take a drug test through the probation office. She ending up testing positive for meth and her excuse was that the meth use was before her arrest (which would have been at least 6 or 7 days prior to the test) and her body processes drugs more slowly because her gallbladder was removed when she was younger. Prosecutor said, \"I'm not a doctor, so I have no idea if that's true, but at the original bond hearing she said that she might test positive for marijuana and last time I checked meth is not marijuana.\"",

So every year, he would call in and ask if he can extend his contract by another year. \n\nWell, last year, as that price was practically non existent, they immediately bumped his price up when he phoned in, stating that he was on a glitched account and his original contract was noot, because they didn't sign a contract every time they extended it. So they charged him over 8000$ for the plan.\n\n\n\nBut what Telus didn't do, or this rep and this whole department didn't do, is that they should have asked to see the contract he had first, and seen that they did do that, and he has emails, phone calls, dates and letters and pictures, to prove that they did.\n\n\n\nSo he takes Telus to court, hires a fancy lawyer, and seeks I think the maximum in B.C Small Claims is $40,000, so $40,000 in mental anguish, breach of contract and pressure tactics, and wins.\n\nThe lawyer warned Telus, and said \"Hey, I put a lot of evidence into discovery for you guys to comb over, are you guys sure you want to pursue this? It's a pretty strong case, I highly advise to look at this!\" Telus said no need, we have our proof.\n\nTheir proof?

All the amended contract emails, agent names, dates, phone call transcripts they got from Telus, everything. \n\nJudge ruled in my buddies favor, and even made the comment \"He gave you a chance\"",

I want it in email.  I want it in writing.\n\nThe number of times I've dug back into my emails (my record is about 10 years prior) and pulled out an ace is unbelievable.\n\nAt one workplace, I got some IT kit quoted.  They failed to supply it all as specified.  It turned into a big argument, and I was a fairly new employee at the time.  It was a LOT of money, and a lot of missing kit.  The supplier was adamant that they'd supplied as quoted, and that we'd need to pay far more if we wanted what we were asking for.\n\nIt literally got to the point where, new to the job, I'm in a meeting with the director of finance of my company (also my direct boss) on one side, and the CEO and finance officers of the supplier involved on the other side.  We're about to be threatened with court action for failing to pay, and we're about to claim they failed to deliver.  It's going to be real messy, and this is the final meeting before we hand it over to lawyers.\n\nThey present reams of evidence, emails, invoices, quotes, etc.  They argue, the director of finance gets really pissed with me that it's had to go this far, and after quite a while of back and forth and a lot of tension in the room, attention turns from both sides to me particularly.\n\nAnd I say:  \"We placed an order, for this kit as we specified, for which we were specifically quoted \u00a3X, which we then agreed to, and which your company accepted, but then did not deliver as specified\".\n\nThe supplier almost laughs at me.\n\n\"Can you prove that?!\"\n\n\"Yes, here is the email chain in question, each with the full headers detailing the time it was sent, received, who to and who by, with the unique Exchange email ID generated by your email servers, where it clearly states the specification that was agreed, a quote with the price for that specification (literally detailed in the quote too), my acceptance of it, and your agent's confirmation of such with an expected delivery date\".\n\nSomehow... it had got to that stage with them having NO RECORD of that email chain, half a dozen emails, from their own employee.  Only earlier quotes and specifications which were later corrected and not ordered until they were correct.  They'd delivered the earlier, incorrect, specification kit, which was missing huge chunks of very expensive and necessary hardware.  And they were trying to claim that we hadn't ordered them.\n\nAdditionally, the final price on the quote / purchase order, etc. was changed from the earlier specifications but only slightly - so it wasn't a copy/paste error, and it was a significantly brilliant deal for the hardware finally quoted for (or I wouldn't have used them!).  Someone their end obviously fucked up and rather than just say that (and we'd have probably just paid the difference at that point), they argued it and their employee had obviously realised, lied and tried to cover up the evidence.",

He was basically arguing with the company, while thinking we were in the wrong, and wouldn't listen or even read our own evidence.\n\nBut their faces (of everyone) when I slid across the printed emails with full headers (and evidentially-rigorous original copies still on the servers) were a picture.  They literally stopped the meeting to phone back to their IT guys and were reading out the message ID to them over the phone.  Turns out, it was a genuine email chain.  Shocking that.  And did, in fact, prove that I'd ordered the kit as specified for the price specified and that they'd entered into a contract to supply that to me at that price, without any objection.\n\nTurns out, I managed to get the best deal ever on a whole raft of very expensive server kit, the missing pieces arrived the next day (at their cost), we terminated all business with that company, and yet my boss never learned the lesson that I keep everything in email for a reason.\n\nAlso fallen foul of this:  A car insurer that terminated my insurance retroactively (which is illegal anyway!) for \"failing to pay\" when my bank were quite surprised by such an assertion as the company had an automatic payment for the insurance under their own control.  This was after I produced a series of every mailed letter from them, still in original envelopes, still with the postmarks, still with the date and document number, including one that they had been claiming didn't exist. They later begged me not to report them to the authorities because they'd basically illegally cancelled my car insurance for non-payment when they'd written \"you are up-to-date on your payments and have nothing more to pay\" in a letter just the day before (and another letter 2 days later which told me they'd cancelled my policy 7 days prior, but was postmarked the day before and yet dated in the future), and for which if I'd been stopped or had an accident in those few days I would have been flagged as \"uninsured\" with serious consequences...\n\nA major mobile phone provider who refused to refund my money because they said I had been sent my new phone, which never arrived, and started taking monthly payments even after I reported it never having arrived and being lost in the post.  Whose only evidence that I ever signed a contract with them was... non-existent.  The contract to be signed was apparently in the lost parcel, too.  So they had no contract, hence no cause to take my money.  (And they'd sent the phone by unrecorded, uninsured, second-class standard post with no tracking so couldn't even prove they'd even sent it!).  They were quite surprised when I kept asking them to furnish me with a copy of this contract I'd allegedly signed that allowed them to keep stealing my money from my account and they were singularly unable to.\n\nAlways keep emails and written copies of everything.",

Nobody has ever been worse at crime in the history of crime.\n\nWe were appointed counsel, which means were private employees who sorta offer to be on standby when they run out of public defenders. We were his fifth; he\u2019d fired the four prior because they kept telling him to just get started on the life sentence because this was already over. They were right.\n\nMy client was on trial because he executed his girlfriend with a pair of gunshots. He did it because she\u2019d secretly aborted a pregnancy that *might* have been his. He found out when he picked her up at the clinic. As they drove home, both of them live texted their hour of conversation, including all of threats to kill her for this when they got home, which he did. \n\nMy client\u2019s apartment building had recently upgraded to full color, telescopic 4k security cameras. We think he didn\u2019t know the upgrade had closed the blind spots. Shit looked like film from the Super Bowl.\n\nMy client was also the only 6\u20194\u201d Hispanic man with bright red hair and a taste for rare, designer sneakers that I and his victim had ever met. This makes it difficult to argue it is \u201cnot him\u201d while the prosecution plays his Gotham City highlight reel on a projector. \n\nMy client not only shot her with *his own gun*, he brought his phone with him while he drove out to the remote spot where it was found.\n\nMy client also texted his friend to buy him the next one way ticket to different country \u201cno questions asked.\u201d He made sure to give him his credit card to buy it though, cause we can\u2019t leave our homies on the hook for that bill.\n\nmy client confessed to his parents and offered to turn himself in.\n\nFinally, my friend client had to hide his grin under his hand while the victim\u2019s family cried on the stand.\n\nThe jury deliberated for 43 minutes.",

Those are usually waived since it's pretty clear if PC existed in DWIs, but the defendant is pro se and refused to waive. So I finish my questioning of the officer. Defendant requests cross. First question: \"Isn't it true you only added the assault charge because when I hit you you started crying like a bitch?\" Fucking stunned the entire courtroom.

We all rise like you typically do and the judge unleashes a tirade telling us to sit down, it's obvious we're from the big city all dressed up, but it's his courtroom and he's in charge. Then the judge mentioned his military service, and I knew that minute we weren't going to win this case. The dad was formal military. I pissed the judge off by not taking the time to know how he operates his courtroom before appearing in it. Judge ordered a dad favorable opinion. Mom was mad. I learned two valuable lessons. The first is that settlement is preferred because you at least have some control over the outcome. And the second is get to know the court you are in.\n\nEdit: Most civil court cases are legally nearly 50/50. Both parties have legal standing to present their version of events and proposed remedies based on legally sound arguments. There's only a cunt hair of legal difference between the two sides. Having a professional relationship with the judge (and county bar association) can be the difference between winning and losing a case. If there's not much to go on. The judge is going to side with the one person they know because it becomes about character and trusting a lawyer's candor at that point. It's just a reality.",

But the plaintiff was *an attorney* and he was claiming that certain conditions of his employment violated his constitutional right to not be a slave.  These horrible conditions were to come to work and do work as assigned by his boss.             \n                  \nSuffice it to say that the judge was not impressed, granted the motion to dismiss, and yes, sanctioned the plaintiff for filing a frivolous lawsuit.",

My job is to resolve tax disputes before trial, and if they go to trial, I am the State's primary witness.\n\nThis means I'm subject to cross examination by the other side (typically the taxpayer).\n\nI was dealing with a difficult [agitated/aggressive] taxpayer for an extended period of time.  This is common before trial - we try not to go to trial, so there was a prolonged period of me trying to explain why we did what we did.  I had some brutal trial prep with our attorneys to get me ready for anticipated cross examination.\n\nTo reiterate, I work for the state equivalent of the IRS, the IRS being a federal agency.  I gave my testimony.  Then the taxpayer was allowed to cross examine me.\n\nHe asked me \"why the IRS disallowed his refund.\"\n\nI explained [for about the fifth time] I do not work for the IRS, and I do not know why the IRS did what they did.  He would need to ask the IRS.\n\nI was tempted to comment that if the IRS also disallowed his refund, it would appear the state-side adjustment was also correct, since we follow federal law.  I decided against it.\n\nNext he said, \"No further questions.\"\n\nGoing to trial is expensive.  Both sides had to split the costs for the court stenographer ($1,400, so $700 each).\n\nDuring the lead-up to the trial, I told him multiple times **we are not the IRS**.\n\nDude literally paid $700 to ask me under oath if I worked for the IRS; because apparently my telling him multiple times that I do not (and all of our correspondences being on my State's letterhead) was not good enough for him.  I think he may have had some brutal follow-up questions for the IRS, and he was completely blindsided by this revelation?  IDK.  The amount at issue was about $3,000; so $700 was a hefty amount for the taxpayer.\n\nOf course he lost.  We knew we were probably going to win before trial, but when he declined to even ask me any questions which could advance his case, it was clearly over.\n\nEdit: minor grammar",

I replied, \"no thanks, ma'am.\"\n\nWell that middle-aged biddy behind the counter misheard that as \"no thanks, man.\"\n\n I got treated to a full up and down tongue lashing how she was many things, but had never been mistaken for a man... Etc etc. It carried on for some time.\n\nI paid without saying another word, and left.\n\nSo if that old woman's hearing is on the way out - you might want to be careful with the usage of ma'am as well . ;)",

The one I went to today, at a pretty busy intersection a couple towns over from me, was the most supportive response I\u2019ve seen from passersby of any I\u2019ve been to before. It\u2019s not a particularly high-density population, it\u2019s actually a pretty mixed bag politically (but leans right rather than left), and there was a *constant* cacophony of people thinking their horns in support and throwing thumbs up, fists, etc. I only saw two people express contrarian opinions the whole time we were there. There were probably around 2000 people at the protest. I was pleasantly surprised.",

The disdain his girlfriend feels for him comes off of her like a stink whenever they're around, and she's not an idiot, so I hope when she leaves him she takes all the kids.

My uncle and my mom refer to her as my cousin's \"little illegal.\" now they have two kids, and of course my uncle loves his grandkids but with what he voted for they could be taken from him now at any moment",

From their perspective, America isn\u2019t a monarchy, no one\u2019s being forced to worship a king, and military parades aren\u2019t unheard of. They probably see the protests as performative outrage\u2014another example of a group that\u2019s always anxious, always catastrophizing, always looking for something to be traumatized by.\n\nBut deeper than that, a lot of conservatives simply live in a different mental world. A lot of conservatives focus on personal responsibility, stability, family, faith, and pride in institutions like the military. So when they see a bunch of people shouting \u201cNo Kings!\u201d on Flag Day, during a military celebration, it feels like an attack not just on Trump, but on the things they value: tradition, order, and national pride.\n\nMany\u2026 maybe even most conservatives don\u2019t walk around feeling like the world is ending. They might be frustrated with politics, but they\u2019re not exhausted by politics like liberals. That\u2019s a big difference. Watching the No Kings protest probably reinforces their belief that liberal culture is defined by crisis\u2014by constant emotional upheaval, symbolic resistance, and identity-based stress.\n\nSo yeah, to some conservatives, it probably looks like a big group therapy session masquerading as a movement. A protest not just against Trump, but against the emotional weight of the entire world\u2014which they never asked to carry.\n\nBut most of them probably just shrug and say: \u201cLet them protest. That\u2019s freedom. Just don\u2019t block traffic.\u201d",

The Inspectors General for all the different Federal agencies produce tons of reports about just that and plenty more is there to find. But dropping Big Balls into a database with Excel's search function is about the most stupid way to deal with it. That Carrier plant Trump was supposed to have saved? Yeah no that's gone, and the jobs with it. The tariffs and resulting trade war have 100% hurt real people and have done nothing to help the entire towns and industries destroyed over the last 50 years by trade policy both parties championed. He said he was going after gang members and criminals here illegally, but it seems like they're getting screamed at to just round up whoever and I still haven't seen anything aimed at the people and companies drawing illegal immigrants here with job offers.\n\nHonestly I think he's doing a lot of lasting damage because in 10, even 20 years when somebody says *\"hey we should really get a handle on problem X\"*, even if they're 100% right, if it's anything Trump claimed he was going to address the instant response will be *\"Oh God, you're just like that Trump guy aren't you?!\"* So we won't be able to address trade issues or trade policies, and we won't be able to address waste/fraud/abuse, and we won't be able to deal with actual criminals who come here illegally, because anyone who suggests it will be painted as being Trump.",

The disdain his girlfriend feels for him comes off of her like a stink whenever they're around, and she's not an idiot, so I hope when she leaves him she takes all the kids. The only reason she hasn't is because he said he'd hide his money and never give her a dollar for the kids.

They probably see the protests as performative outrage\u2014another example of a group that\u2019s always anxious, always catastrophizing, always looking for something to be traumatized by.\n\nBut deeper than that, a lot of conservatives simply live in a different mental world. A lot of conservatives focus on personal responsibility, stability, family, faith, and pride in institutions like the military. So when they see a bunch of people shouting \u201cNo Kings!\u201d on Flag Day, during a military celebration, it feels like an attack not just on Trump, but on the things they value: tradition, order, and national pride.\n\nMany\u2026 maybe even most conservatives don\u2019t walk around feeling like the world is ending. They might be frustrated with politics, but they\u2019re not exhausted by politics like liberals. That\u2019s a big difference. Watching the No Kings protest probably reinforces their belief that liberal culture is defined by crisis\u2014by constant emotional upheaval, symbolic resistance, and identity-based stress.\n\nSo yeah, to some conservatives, it probably looks like a big group therapy session masquerading as a movement. A protest not just against Trump, but against the emotional weight of the entire world\u2014which they never asked to carry.\n\nBut most of them probably just shrug and say: \u201cLet them protest.

It\u2019s not a particularly high-density population, it\u2019s actually a pretty mixed bag politically (but leans right rather than left), and there was a *constant* cacophony of people thinking their horns in support and throwing thumbs up, fists, etc. I only saw two people express contrarian opinions the whole time we were there.

I am so disappointed and disgusted in what he's become. He doesn't deserve those kids. The disdain his girlfriend feels for him comes off of her like a stink whenever they're around, and she's not an idiot, so I hope when she leaves him she takes all the kids. The only reason she hasn't is because he said he'd hide his money and never give her a dollar for the kids.

When it\u2019s others they\u2019re selfish and lazy and welfare queen and gaming the system in their little circles but when it\u2019s THEM?? oh well actually you see here there\u2019s a totally legit reason why (like with food stamps or Medicaid/medicare). Depressing as hell for them to NOT get it; treating their fellow citizen equally and fairly with empathy, protection from kings (kind of our thing), and that government should ESPECIALLY protect us against corporations snd special interest groups and GROUPS OF PEOPLE (BILLIONAIRES) that have motivations to pervert the government and we can obviously see [I am ready to verbose if you want to ask AI the Summary].\n\nAll most of us expect and want is:\n- reasonable control (plan b and abortions) and expression of THEIR OWN BODIES since it\u2019s neither affecting or hurting anyone else (if so please tell me in the comments I\u2019m curious), and by extension insurance that is still allowed to make profits but not obscenely. Reasonable access to services, the providers paid well enough and without issue, quite a few plan offerings and your past legit use of health insurance NOT affecting your rates by ~ 150% as it did our company last year even as a 25ish insurance users \u2014 but overall INSURANCE NOT TIED TO WORK as it is often abused. \n- A LIVABLE wage, worker protections and benefits but most important as GENUINE respect as human:human humility, and the company to not be evil morally in general (I get weapons and DARPA shit and both love cool tech but hate the INDUSTRY and players and their ethics and we aren\u2019t even talking about the killing people aspect already)\n- actual pragmatic protections of vulnerable classes especially\n- border protection, but making actual EFFICIENT and pragmatic approaches and avenues for immigration to this country. It\u2019s literally what built our entire country. We are all literally immigrants here except for Native Americans\n\n\u201cYou can tell a lot about a society by the way, they treat their lowest especially most vulnerable &amp; disenfranchised\u201d or something is another quote I really think about often",

Had a good conversation with him - super friendly, objective. We disagreed on a number of things, but he wasn\u2019t rabid Republican. He wants better border control but is appalled at what ICE is doing. He is post- Vietnam era vet and feels his party has betrayed him. I DIDN\u2019T have the guts to ask him if he voted for Trump in 2016 or 2020; he claims he did not in 2024.",

Their values are whatever gives them power which is Trump.\n\nI dont necessarily disagree with your comment, except it seems to define conservatism as \"whatever ideology happens to be most prevalent in the GOP\". Which... fair. For too many so-called conservatives, that ideology ended up being secondary to GOP/MAGA group identity and has now been almost entirely discarded.\n\nWhich really sucks for the country bc having honest, good faith people in politics whose instincts lean towards \"maybe things are the way they are for a good reason so let's not hurry up and upend them\" is as important as the \"shit's fucked, let's fix it\" people",

From their perspective, America isn\u2019t a monarchy, no one\u2019s being forced to worship a king, and military parades aren\u2019t unheard of. They probably see the protests as performative outrage\u2014another example of a group that\u2019s always anxious, always catastrophizing, always looking for something to be traumatized by.\n\nBut deeper than that, a lot of conservatives simply live in a different mental world. A lot of conservatives focus on personal responsibility, stability, family, faith, and pride in institutions like the military. So when they see a bunch of people shouting \u201cNo Kings!\u201d on Flag Day, during a military celebration, it feels like an attack not just on Trump, but on the things they value: tradition, order, and national pride.\n\nMany\u2026 maybe even most conservatives don\u2019t walk around feeling like the world is ending. They might be frustrated with politics, but they\u2019re not exhausted by politics like liberals. That\u2019s a big difference. Watching the No Kings protest probably reinforces their belief that liberal culture is defined by crisis\u2014by constant emotional upheaval, symbolic resistance, and identity-based stress.\n\nSo yeah, to some conservatives, it probably looks like a big group therapy session masquerading as a movement. A protest not just against Trump, but against the emotional weight of the entire world\u2014which they never asked to carry.\n\nBut most of them probably just shrug and say: \u201cLet them protest. That\u2019s freedom. Just don\u2019t block traffic.\u201d",

Canada used to have a patent system called compulsory licensing: for drugs considered vital to the health system, patent holders were not allowed to refuse to license production to third parties / generic manufacturers, and licensing rates were legislated at 4% of net sale price. The US viewed this practice with hostility, although it kept drug prices quite low in Canada. It was targeted during NAFTA negotiations and since then, drug prices in Canada have more than doubled.",

Think of how many other medicines we want, but do not presently have.\n\n2. It can easily cost $1 billion to get a drug to the clinical trial stage. In case the Total Addressable Market (TAM) &lt; $1 billion, there is just no way to sustainably address such diseases. Rare diseases are also more expensive to research because they may take longer to identify or acquire good data on.\n\n3. All medical research is a gamble because you never know what will actually work and what will have side effects discovered years from now. *The successful drugs need to also fund all the unsuccessful attempts and the inevitable lawsuits due to side effects which were not foreseen.*",

There is a significant risk of eye disease (read vision loss) for those who have uncontrolled diabetes and have persued this medication. GLP1s were discovered in 1988. In 1993, they were first injected into type 1 diabetics, but the side effects warranted seeking alternatives. Ozempic (read semaglutide) was in phase II clinical trials (read does it actually work tho, which leads way to phase III, does it work at scale). Clinical trials ended in 2017, 8 years ago. The effects out from that limited trial aren't known, which is what is being discovered now. \n\nYour understanding is ignoring a lot of documented proof of its evolution throughout the lifespan of the drug. There were a lot of scares about other side effects (extra weight gain after), but it's important to not spread misinformation. It's a lifelong drug, whose effects rebound when you're off it.\n\nThe \"seriously\" bad side effects are a matter of interpretation. You could get off it, gain a tremendous amount of weight, which will increase all the complications of diabetes. For now, the best choice is that if you're on it, stay on it. If you're not, don't start, unless your doctor deems it worthy. There are a huge number of side effects, as with all drugs. But implying that there aren't any \"seriously bad side effects\" is a gross miscarriage of knowledge.",

The problem a lot of people have is that they use the jabs to get their intake under control but don't really make any material changes to their diet, so when they come back off, they go back to eating as they did before and put the weight back on.\n\nLast year I started calorie counting and lost 20kg but plateaued and didn't lose anything for six months, I combined it with one of the jabs and I've lost 3kg in two weeks. I'll be starting at the gym soon, so hopefully I'll be at my goal in September.",

Novo didn't renew it because the patent wasn't eligible to be renewed, not because they \"forgot\".\n\nBut biotech, patents may not be enough to protect R&amp;D investments -- partly due to the length of time it takes to get a new medicine approved.  Often by the time the drug goes through all the clinical trials and get final approval, the patent is already near expiration.\n\nSo many countries offer additional protections for new medicine that are considered \"innovative drugs\": exclusivity around access and use of the clinical / medical data required to register the medicine.\n\nPart of \"Regulatory Data Protection\" (RDP), data exclusivity is typically for 8 years, and sometimes combined with a couple additional years of market protection.\n\n**In Canada, data exclusivity / market protection is for 8 years**.   Since Ozempic was first registered in January of 2018, its protection in Canada will end in January of 2026.\n\nOzempic protections will similarly end in many other countries around the same time.  In Europe I believe they get 10 years of RDP so market protection will end in 2028.\n\nIn the US, however, the USPTO dragged their feet when they were examining semaglutide, and because of that Novo Nordisk was granted a lengthy *patent* *extension*.\n\nAs a result, one of the US semaglutide patents will remain in effect until 2031 so generics are not expected to enter until 2032.",

Tirzapatide in turn is 20-25 percent better than semaglutide, again based on clinical trials.\n\nWith the caveat that real-world outcomes are around 30-40 percent lower due to various factors like access issues and dropout. Either way, they are quickly improving as they hit more targets and/or lead to oral formulations.\n\nUnfortunately rebound weight gain is pretty universal with these compounds, so I strongly suggest implementing a diet/exercise plan and losing some weight that way before getting started and maintaining that approach through treatment.\n\nAt least that's what my doctor suggested, but I was already 10 percent down on my own, so that wasn't an issue in my particular case. But you do get even better results, perhaps not by bodyweight per se, as that's not a great metric for someone building some muscle at the same time, but certainly healthier and happier!\n\nMy favorite part of tirzapatide is I don't get horrible stomach cramps when I don't eat for a day or two (whoo amphetamines for ADHD.)

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Its orders were to soften up the beach for what was a fake Marine landing, a ruse to keep the Iraqis guessing and keeping troops guarding the beaches.  \n\nThe captain of the Missouri fired every last shell for the 16 inche main guns(783 of them) knowing this was \u201clast call\u201d for the mighty battleship. The Iraqis fired two shore to ship Silkworm missiles at her( one crashed, the other intercepted), and the crew responded by sending 54 shells from the 16inch batteries and destroying the launch site.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Anti-personnel, whereas we've now seen $500 FPV drones more effective in Ukraine.\n\nSwitchblade drones: (600 variant) - Unclear, but estimated $100k+. Anti-armor (akin to ATGM). Last known production was ~6,000/year. In comparison, Ukraine is currently producing more than this per day that work similarly.\n\nShit's expensive. More than it should be.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well. And also now that drones are being mass produced and used in high numbers for a much lower (relatively speaking) cost.",

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well. And also now that drones are being mass produced and used in high numbers for a much lower (relatively speaking) cost.",

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

The movie's about an Ebola-like virus the military is trying to contain (to use for germ warfare), which means destroying the evidence of it out in the field.  In the opening sequence the military drops a bomb so big it's sitting on palette and needs to be slowed down via parachute.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

They are not technically antipersonnel weapons.\n\nThe MOAB is designed to blow the shit out of people in caves, or underground, etc. More of a \"fuck accuracy, kill everything in a big radius\" concept. \n\nBasically, although both are massive booms, the blast pattern is different. \n\nI could be wrong I guess.",

They were originally intended for clearing emergency helicopter landing zones in heavy jungle cover, like Vietnam.\n\nAnd FWIW, its replacement (which actually was designed as a weapon) is much bigger in both size and blast. The BLU-82 was about 15,000lbs, 12ft long and 4.5ft in diameter, with around 12,600lbs of GSX (roughy equivalent to the same weight of TNT). The replacement GBU-43/B MOAB is roughly 22,000lbs, 30ft long, 3.5ft diameter, GPS guided, with an H-6 fill equivalent to around 25,000lbs of TNT.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well. And also now that drones are being mass produced and used in high numbers for a much lower (relatively speaking) cost.",

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

They are not technically antipersonnel weapons.\n\nThe MOAB is designed to blow the shit out of people in caves, or underground, etc. More of a \"fuck accuracy, kill everything in a big radius\" concept. \n\nBasically, although both are massive booms, the blast pattern is different. \n\nI could be wrong I guess.",

They were originally intended for clearing emergency helicopter landing zones in heavy jungle cover, like Vietnam.\n\nAnd FWIW, its replacement (which actually was designed as a weapon) is much bigger in both size and blast. The BLU-82 was about 15,000lbs, 12ft long and 4.5ft in diameter, with around 12,600lbs of GSX (roughy equivalent to the same weight of TNT). The replacement GBU-43/B MOAB is roughly 22,000lbs, 30ft long, 3.5ft diameter, GPS guided, with an H-6 fill equivalent to around 25,000lbs of TNT.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well. And also now that drones are being mass produced and used in high numbers for a much lower (relatively speaking) cost.",

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well. And also now that drones are being mass produced and used in high numbers for a much lower (relatively speaking) cost.",

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

It did some damage and injured three sailors. Wisconsin trained all nine of her 16 inch guns on the single artillery position and literally changed the geography of Korea. The next ship in trail, the USS Duncan, signaled to Wisconsin \"Temper temper\"",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

By the time it was done we had about an hour of range time left and a full days worth of ammo. The process to return ammo to the ammo depot I guess was a pain in the ass so our platoon Sgt told us we had an hour to burn it all. So many rounds continuously flying down range for an hour was a lot of fun.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well. And also now that drones are being mass produced and used in high numbers for a much lower (relatively speaking) cost.",

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well.

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",

You can see numbers in the hundreds or thousands and be like, \"Wow, that's a lot!\"... then realize later on that it's actually a small amount in a real war where there isn't instant air domination.\n\nSome examples...\n\nStinger missiles: ~40/month up until 2023 (then increased to 60/month). They also cost nearly $500k each.\n\nJavelins: 20-25k total in the US arsenal as of 2021 (10k+ given to Ukraine). ~$250k each.\n\nSwitchblade drones: (300 variant) - $53k each. Anti-personnel, whereas we've now seen $500 FPV drones more effective in Ukraine.\n\nSwitchblade drones: (600 variant) - Unclear, but estimated $100k+. Anti-armor (akin to ATGM). Last known production was ~6,000/year. In comparison, Ukraine is currently producing more than this per day that work similarly.\n\nShit's expensive. More than it should be.",

Defensive operations is where you'd use these man portable weapons more like you see in Ukraine, since you're a pop up threat to advancing tanks and low flying aircraft that can shoot and scoot immediately. \n\nBut with the US shifting more towards fighting against conventional militaries again and not insurgency like they have the last two decades, it will be interesting to see if the weapons they produce will change as well. And also now that drones are being mass produced and used in high numbers for a much lower (relatively speaking) cost.",

For the vast majority of countries, that wouldn't be an issue. The only ones I see being any issue at all are Russia and China (moreso China). Two weeks ago I may have said Iran, but it seems as though Israel alone has annihilated their air defense. The only other one that is a *possible* would be NK.\n\nRealistically, if you have air domination then any form of armor (tanks etc.) is useless. It's going to get bombed as soon as it pops up. The war would be almost purely infantry/drones, and quickly devolve to indirect warfare unless it was mostly state action rather than ideology-based (see: Iraq vs Afghanistan).\n\nIf air domination is not achieved, then all strategies are basically fucked. The war is already either lost or going to be complete shit with the draft coming back. Realistically (again), though, there is no war with China or NK that does not involve the exchange of nukes, so all of those strategies go out the window anyway.",
