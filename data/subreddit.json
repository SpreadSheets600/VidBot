                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.  That would at least be the baloney sandwich of tipping.",

                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.

When I was in high school, we once arrived home to find all of our utilities shut off. We used the neighbors phone to call the utility companies and found out the bills weren't paid. My mother gave my brother the bills to put in the mailbox. We found months of bills under my brothers mattress. He put them there and forgot about it. Then I got stuck being the responsible one all the time. A blessing in disguise",

That was reserved for emergencies; if you needed to ask a question you get off your butt and go find the person you need to talk to. \n\nNow as an adult, when I'm at other people's homes and they are yelling from various rooms at each other it feels so aggressive, haha. If I'm asking you how many hotdogs you want on the BBQ for dinner I just go find you in the basement, I don't scream, \"BRIAN!!! HOW MANY HOT DOGS DO YOU WANT?? HOT DOGS. HOW MANY. DID YOU SAY THREE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU\"",

                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.

When I was in high school, we once arrived home to find all of our utilities shut off. We used the neighbors phone to call the utility companies and found out the bills weren't paid. My mother gave my brother the bills to put in the mailbox. We found months of bills under my brothers mattress. He put them there and forgot about it. Then I got stuck being the responsible one all the time. A blessing in disguise",

That was reserved for emergencies; if you needed to ask a question you get off your butt and go find the person you need to talk to. \n\nNow as an adult, when I'm at other people's homes and they are yelling from various rooms at each other it feels so aggressive, haha. If I'm asking you how many hotdogs you want on the BBQ for dinner I just go find you in the basement, I don't scream, \"BRIAN!!! HOW MANY HOT DOGS DO YOU WANT?? HOT DOGS. HOW MANY. DID YOU SAY THREE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU\"",

                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.

Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.

If I'm asking you how many hotdogs you want on the BBQ for dinner I just go find you in the basement, I don't scream, \"BRIAN!!! HOW MANY HOT DOGS DO YOU WANT?? HOT DOGS. HOW MANY. DID YOU SAY THREE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU\"",

Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.  That would at least be the baloney sandwich of tipping.",

Then tidying up her room. My kids put their dishes in the sink when they are finished as soon as they can reach - that\u2019s so they don\u2019t throw them and break something glass. We have them transport laundry to the washer. We also have them help with preparing meals whenever possible and especially when they show interest.\n\nWhen I was growing up, the rule was also \u201cwhen you can reach\u201d - when you\u2019re tall enough to press the buttons on the washing machine, that becomes your chore. When you\u2019re tall enough to lean over the sink and reach the water, you wash them/load the dishwasher. \n\nIt\u2019s always fascinating to me to see how much my kids want or know to do already just by observing us do it. They love to help sweep and have started to show interest in vacuuming. Just giving them the chance to hold things and praising them goes a long way. Then, once they show an interest in things at the store (\u201ccan I have that?\u201d, \u201ccan I have this for my birthday?\u201d), you can build in an allowance system. \n\nKudos to you for being willing to ask!!",

If I had a play or a game I wanted him to come to, I'd say it started 2-3 hours earlier than it actually did and he'd still miss most if not all of it. His band nickname was \"Tony Late\" because they'd wait and wait for him, finally start without their lead guitar and backup vocals only to have him jump on stage several songs in, plug in his guitar, and start playing like nothing happened. The longest he was ever late was over 24 hours, and that was with him constantly telling us he'd already left. He lived an hour away.",

Would have guessed he was a lawyer, if he was sitting ahead of the bar.\n\nHe stands up, and says out loud, \"Well, I have a driver's liscence with that name on it, but as its in capitals you can see that's the name of a corporation, your honour.\"\n\nThe justice on the bench did his best to be reasonable with this guy. But the guy immeadiatly starts a speech about how the system is corrupt and there needs to be changes. \nHe would go on about that several times in the next while.\n\nThis first time, the justice says, \"That's not what we are here to discuss today. We're here for a speeding ticket. And if *defendant's name* doesn't present himself in front of this bar, I'm ruling a conviction in absense.\"\n\nSo the defendant hustles in front of the bar (officially presenting himself for the case, behind the bar is gallery only) and proceeds to start an indignant series of acid born arguements that were so bizzare as to verge on schitzophrenia.\n\nHighlights were: \n\nTrying to invoke papal law. To which the justice responds, \"Papal law? This isn't rome, that doesn't apply here.\"\n\nDefendant tries to quote admiralty law, which perplexes the justice as, \"Where do you get admiralty law? This is Alberta, this is the most landlocked province in the country. Where do you get admiralty law?\"\nThe defendant replies, straight faced and serious, \"Well there used to be a fountain in the basement, sir.\"\n\nMind you, defendant hasn't even made his initial plea yet. Multiple times the justice tries to steer him back on track, and the guy keeps responding, \"Well, I did it, but that's not the point.\"\n\nSo well after a balif has been called to keep an eye on this thing, and I, witnessing this, have finally realized I wasn't dreaming, the justice on the bench finally says, \"Ok. Fine, you've said you've done it multiple times before, and I'll accept that as a guilty plea.\"  Hands out fine and thirty days to pay, next case.",

The supplier was adamant that they'd supplied as quoted, and that we'd need to pay far more if we wanted what we were asking for.\n\nIt literally got to the point where, new to the job, I'm in a meeting with the director of finance of my company (also my direct boss) on one side, and the CEO and finance officers of the supplier involved on the other side.  We're about to be threatened with court action for failing to pay, and we're about to claim they failed to deliver.  It's going to be real messy, and this is the final meeting before we hand it over to lawyers.\n\nThey present reams of evidence, emails, invoices, quotes, etc.  They argue, the director of finance gets really pissed with me that it's had to go this far, and after quite a while of back and forth and a lot of tension in the room, attention turns from both sides to me particularly.\n\nAnd I say:  \"We placed an order, for this kit as we specified, for which we were specifically quoted \u00a3X, which we then agreed to, and which your company accepted, but then did not deliver as specified\".\n\nThe supplier almost laughs at me.\n\n\"Can you prove that?!\"\n\n\"Yes, here is the email chain in question, each with the full headers detailing the time it was sent, received, who to and who by, with the unique Exchange email ID generated by your email servers, where it clearly states the specification that was agreed, a quote with the price for that specification (literally detailed in the quote too), my acceptance of it, and your agent's confirmation of such with an expected delivery date\".\n\nSomehow... it had got to that stage with them having NO RECORD of that email chain, half a dozen emails, from their own employee.  Only earlier quotes and specifications which were later corrected and not ordered until they were correct.  They'd delivered the earlier, incorrect, specification kit, which was missing huge chunks of very expensive and necessary hardware.  And they were trying to claim that we hadn't ordered them.\n\nAdditionally, the final price on the quote / purchase order, etc. was changed from the earlier specifications but only slightly - so it wasn't a copy/paste error, and it was a significantly brilliant deal for the hardware finally quoted for (or I wouldn't have used them!).  Someone their end obviously fucked up and rather than just say that (and we'd have probably just paid the difference at that point), they argued it and their employee had obviously realised, lied and tried to cover up the evidence.",

                                "body": "Even my boss just kept saying to me that he wasn't interested and believed I'd fucked up, even though I'd showed him those emails.  I think he just wanted me to take the fall because he thought I'd been the one to fuck up, and he didn't read what I was sending him (this was a common theme over the next 8 years of working there, and every time he fell face-first into the evidence of my emails, including one incident where he SCREAMED down a phone that he hadn't ever been notified of something I'd done, so as he was doing so I re-forwarded the email I'd sent him at the time stating exactly that, and his dismissive response to it).  He was basically arguing with the company, while thinking we were in the wrong, and wouldn't listen or even read our own evidence.\n\nBut their faces (of everyone) when I slid across the printed emails with full headers (and evidentially-rigorous original copies still on the servers) were a picture.  They literally stopped the meeting to phone back to their IT guys and were reading out the message ID to them over the phone.  Turns out, it was a genuine email chain.  Shocking that.  And did, in fact, prove that I'd ordered the kit as specified for the price specified and that they'd entered into a contract to supply that to me at that price, without any objection.\n\nTurns out, I managed to get the best deal ever on a whole raft of very expensive server kit, the missing pieces arrived the next day (at their cost), we terminated all business with that company, and yet my boss never learned the lesson that I keep everything in email for a reason.\n\nAlso fallen foul of this:  A car insurer that terminated my insurance retroactively (which is illegal anyway!) for \"failing to pay\" when my bank were quite surprised by such an assertion as the company had an automatic payment for the insurance under their own control.  This was after I produced a series of every mailed letter from them, still in original envelopes, still with the postmarks, still with the date and document number, including one that they had been claiming didn't exist. They later begged me not to report them to the authorities because they'd basically illegally cancelled my car insurance for non-payment when they'd written \"you are up-to-date on your payments and have nothing more to pay\" in a letter just the day before (and another letter 2 days later which told me they'd cancelled my policy 7 days prior, but was postmarked the day before and yet dated in the future), and for which if I'd been stopped or had an accident in those few days I would have been flagged as \"uninsured\" with serious consequences...\n\nA major mobile phone provider who refused to refund my money because they said I had been sent my new phone, which never arrived, and started taking monthly payments even after I reported it never having arrived and being lost in the post.  Whose only evidence that I ever signed a contract with them was... non-existent.  The contract to be signed was apparently in the lost parcel, too.  So they had no contract, hence no cause to take my money.  (And they'd sent the phone by unrecorded, uninsured, second-class standard post with no tracking so couldn't even prove they'd even sent it!).  They were quite surprised when I kept asking them to furnish me with a copy of this contract I'd allegedly signed that allowed them to keep stealing my money from my account and they were singularly unable to.\n\nAlways keep emails and written copies of everything.",

Mom, my client, wouldn't agree to a rather good settlement agreement and wanted her way 100%. She wanted a judge to decide rather than the parties settling where they both walk away winning and losing in a sense. The hearing starts, and the judge enters. We all rise like you typically do and the judge unleashes a tirade telling us to sit down, it's obvious we're from the big city all dressed up, but it's his courtroom and he's in charge. Then the judge mentioned his military service, and I knew that minute we weren't going to win this case. The dad was formal military. I pissed the judge off by not taking the time to know how he operates his courtroom before appearing in it. Judge ordered a dad favorable opinion. Mom was mad. I learned two valuable lessons. The first is that settlement is preferred because you at least have some control over the outcome. And the second is get to know the court you are in.\n\nEdit: Most civil court cases are legally nearly 50/50. Both parties have legal standing to present their version of events and proposed remedies based on legally sound arguments. There's only a cunt hair of legal difference between the two sides. Having a professional relationship with the judge (and county bar association) can be the difference between winning and losing a case. If there's not much to go on. The judge is going to side with the one person they know because it becomes about character and trusting a lawyer's candor at that point. It's just a reality.",

My job is to resolve tax disputes before trial, and if they go to trial, I am the State's primary witness.\n\nThis means I'm subject to cross examination by the other side (typically the taxpayer).\n\nI was dealing with a difficult [agitated/aggressive] taxpayer for an extended period of time.  This is common before trial - we try not to go to trial, so there was a prolonged period of me trying to explain why we did what we did.  I had some brutal trial prep with our attorneys to get me ready for anticipated cross examination.\n\nTo reiterate, I work for the state equivalent of the IRS, the IRS being a federal agency.  I gave my testimony.  Then the taxpayer was allowed to cross examine me.\n\nHe asked me \"why the IRS disallowed his refund.\"\n\nI explained [for about the fifth time] I do not work for the IRS, and I do not know why the IRS did what they did.  He would need to ask the IRS.\n\nI was tempted to comment that if the IRS also disallowed his refund, it would appear the state-side adjustment was also correct, since we follow federal law.  I decided against it.\n\nNext he said, \"No further questions.\"\n\nGoing to trial is expensive.  Both sides had to split the costs for the court stenographer ($1,400, so $700 each).\n\nDuring the lead-up to the trial, I told him multiple times **we are not the IRS**.\n\nDude literally paid $700 to ask me under oath if I worked for the IRS; because apparently my telling him multiple times that I do not (and all of our correspondences being on my State's letterhead) was not good enough for him.  I think he may have had some brutal follow-up questions for the IRS, and he was completely blindsided by this revelation?  IDK.  The amount at issue was about $3,000; so $700 was a hefty amount for the taxpayer.\n\nOf course he lost.  We knew we were probably going to win before trial, but when he declined to even ask me any questions which could advance his case, it was clearly over.\n\nEdit: minor grammar",

At her original bond hearing, when told she would have to do a drug test upon release, she admitted to marijuana use that might show up on the test, but was ultimately granted bond and given 7 days to take a drug test through the probation office. She ending up testing positive for meth and her excuse was that the meth use was before her arrest (which would have been at least 6 or 7 days prior to the test) and her body processes drugs more slowly because her gallbladder was removed when she was younger. Prosecutor said, \"I'm not a doctor, so I have no idea if that's true, but at the original bond hearing she said that she might test positive for marijuana and last time I checked meth is not marijuana.\"",

So every year, he would call in and ask if he can extend his contract by another year. \n\nWell, last year, as that price was practically non existent, they immediately bumped his price up when he phoned in, stating that he was on a glitched account and his original contract was noot, because they didn't sign a contract every time they extended it. So they charged him over 8000$ for the plan.\n\n\n\nBut what Telus didn't do, or this rep and this whole department didn't do, is that they should have asked to see the contract he had first, and seen that they did do that, and he has emails, phone calls, dates and letters and pictures, to prove that they did.\n\n\n\nSo he takes Telus to court, hires a fancy lawyer, and seeks I think the maximum in B.C Small Claims is $40,000, so $40,000 in mental anguish, breach of contract and pressure tactics, and wins.\n\nThe lawyer warned Telus, and said \"Hey, I put a lot of evidence into discovery for you guys to comb over, are you guys sure you want to pursue this? It's a pretty strong case, I highly advise to look at this!\" Telus said no need, we have our proof.\n\nTheir proof?

All the amended contract emails, agent names, dates, phone call transcripts they got from Telus, everything. \n\nJudge ruled in my buddies favor, and even made the comment \"He gave you a chance\"",

I want it in email.  I want it in writing.\n\nThe number of times I've dug back into my emails (my record is about 10 years prior) and pulled out an ace is unbelievable.\n\nAt one workplace, I got some IT kit quoted.  They failed to supply it all as specified.  It turned into a big argument, and I was a fairly new employee at the time.  It was a LOT of money, and a lot of missing kit.  The supplier was adamant that they'd supplied as quoted, and that we'd need to pay far more if we wanted what we were asking for.\n\nIt literally got to the point where, new to the job, I'm in a meeting with the director of finance of my company (also my direct boss) on one side, and the CEO and finance officers of the supplier involved on the other side.  We're about to be threatened with court action for failing to pay, and we're about to claim they failed to deliver.  It's going to be real messy, and this is the final meeting before we hand it over to lawyers.\n\nThey present reams of evidence, emails, invoices, quotes, etc.  They argue, the director of finance gets really pissed with me that it's had to go this far, and after quite a while of back and forth and a lot of tension in the room, attention turns from both sides to me particularly.\n\nAnd I say:  \"We placed an order, for this kit as we specified, for which we were specifically quoted \u00a3X, which we then agreed to, and which your company accepted, but then did not deliver as specified\".\n\nThe supplier almost laughs at me.\n\n\"Can you prove that?!\"\n\n\"Yes, here is the email chain in question, each with the full headers detailing the time it was sent, received, who to and who by, with the unique Exchange email ID generated by your email servers, where it clearly states the specification that was agreed, a quote with the price for that specification (literally detailed in the quote too), my acceptance of it, and your agent's confirmation of such with an expected delivery date\".\n\nSomehow... it had got to that stage with them having NO RECORD of that email chain, half a dozen emails, from their own employee.  Only earlier quotes and specifications which were later corrected and not ordered until they were correct.  They'd delivered the earlier, incorrect, specification kit, which was missing huge chunks of very expensive and necessary hardware.  And they were trying to claim that we hadn't ordered them.\n\nAdditionally, the final price on the quote / purchase order, etc. was changed from the earlier specifications but only slightly - so it wasn't a copy/paste error, and it was a significantly brilliant deal for the hardware finally quoted for (or I wouldn't have used them!).  Someone their end obviously fucked up and rather than just say that (and we'd have probably just paid the difference at that point), they argued it and their employee had obviously realised, lied and tried to cover up the evidence.",

He was basically arguing with the company, while thinking we were in the wrong, and wouldn't listen or even read our own evidence.\n\nBut their faces (of everyone) when I slid across the printed emails with full headers (and evidentially-rigorous original copies still on the servers) were a picture.  They literally stopped the meeting to phone back to their IT guys and were reading out the message ID to them over the phone.  Turns out, it was a genuine email chain.  Shocking that.  And did, in fact, prove that I'd ordered the kit as specified for the price specified and that they'd entered into a contract to supply that to me at that price, without any objection.\n\nTurns out, I managed to get the best deal ever on a whole raft of very expensive server kit, the missing pieces arrived the next day (at their cost), we terminated all business with that company, and yet my boss never learned the lesson that I keep everything in email for a reason.\n\nAlso fallen foul of this:  A car insurer that terminated my insurance retroactively (which is illegal anyway!) for \"failing to pay\" when my bank were quite surprised by such an assertion as the company had an automatic payment for the insurance under their own control.  This was after I produced a series of every mailed letter from them, still in original envelopes, still with the postmarks, still with the date and document number, including one that they had been claiming didn't exist. They later begged me not to report them to the authorities because they'd basically illegally cancelled my car insurance for non-payment when they'd written \"you are up-to-date on your payments and have nothing more to pay\" in a letter just the day before (and another letter 2 days later which told me they'd cancelled my policy 7 days prior, but was postmarked the day before and yet dated in the future), and for which if I'd been stopped or had an accident in those few days I would have been flagged as \"uninsured\" with serious consequences...\n\nA major mobile phone provider who refused to refund my money because they said I had been sent my new phone, which never arrived, and started taking monthly payments even after I reported it never having arrived and being lost in the post.  Whose only evidence that I ever signed a contract with them was... non-existent.  The contract to be signed was apparently in the lost parcel, too.  So they had no contract, hence no cause to take my money.  (And they'd sent the phone by unrecorded, uninsured, second-class standard post with no tracking so couldn't even prove they'd even sent it!).  They were quite surprised when I kept asking them to furnish me with a copy of this contract I'd allegedly signed that allowed them to keep stealing my money from my account and they were singularly unable to.\n\nAlways keep emails and written copies of everything.",

Nobody has ever been worse at crime in the history of crime.\n\nWe were appointed counsel, which means were private employees who sorta offer to be on standby when they run out of public defenders. We were his fifth; he\u2019d fired the four prior because they kept telling him to just get started on the life sentence because this was already over. They were right.\n\nMy client was on trial because he executed his girlfriend with a pair of gunshots. He did it because she\u2019d secretly aborted a pregnancy that *might* have been his. He found out when he picked her up at the clinic. As they drove home, both of them live texted their hour of conversation, including all of threats to kill her for this when they got home, which he did. \n\nMy client\u2019s apartment building had recently upgraded to full color, telescopic 4k security cameras. We think he didn\u2019t know the upgrade had closed the blind spots. Shit looked like film from the Super Bowl.\n\nMy client was also the only 6\u20194\u201d Hispanic man with bright red hair and a taste for rare, designer sneakers that I and his victim had ever met. This makes it difficult to argue it is \u201cnot him\u201d while the prosecution plays his Gotham City highlight reel on a projector. \n\nMy client not only shot her with *his own gun*, he brought his phone with him while he drove out to the remote spot where it was found.\n\nMy client also texted his friend to buy him the next one way ticket to different country \u201cno questions asked.\u201d He made sure to give him his credit card to buy it though, cause we can\u2019t leave our homies on the hook for that bill.\n\nmy client confessed to his parents and offered to turn himself in.\n\nFinally, my friend client had to hide his grin under his hand while the victim\u2019s family cried on the stand.\n\nThe jury deliberated for 43 minutes.",

Those are usually waived since it's pretty clear if PC existed in DWIs, but the defendant is pro se and refused to waive. So I finish my questioning of the officer. Defendant requests cross. First question: \"Isn't it true you only added the assault charge because when I hit you you started crying like a bitch?\" Fucking stunned the entire courtroom.

We all rise like you typically do and the judge unleashes a tirade telling us to sit down, it's obvious we're from the big city all dressed up, but it's his courtroom and he's in charge. Then the judge mentioned his military service, and I knew that minute we weren't going to win this case. The dad was formal military. I pissed the judge off by not taking the time to know how he operates his courtroom before appearing in it. Judge ordered a dad favorable opinion. Mom was mad. I learned two valuable lessons. The first is that settlement is preferred because you at least have some control over the outcome. And the second is get to know the court you are in.\n\nEdit: Most civil court cases are legally nearly 50/50. Both parties have legal standing to present their version of events and proposed remedies based on legally sound arguments. There's only a cunt hair of legal difference between the two sides. Having a professional relationship with the judge (and county bar association) can be the difference between winning and losing a case. If there's not much to go on. The judge is going to side with the one person they know because it becomes about character and trusting a lawyer's candor at that point. It's just a reality.",

But the plaintiff was *an attorney* and he was claiming that certain conditions of his employment violated his constitutional right to not be a slave.  These horrible conditions were to come to work and do work as assigned by his boss.             \n                  \nSuffice it to say that the judge was not impressed, granted the motion to dismiss, and yes, sanctioned the plaintiff for filing a frivolous lawsuit.",

My job is to resolve tax disputes before trial, and if they go to trial, I am the State's primary witness.\n\nThis means I'm subject to cross examination by the other side (typically the taxpayer).\n\nI was dealing with a difficult [agitated/aggressive] taxpayer for an extended period of time.  This is common before trial - we try not to go to trial, so there was a prolonged period of me trying to explain why we did what we did.  I had some brutal trial prep with our attorneys to get me ready for anticipated cross examination.\n\nTo reiterate, I work for the state equivalent of the IRS, the IRS being a federal agency.  I gave my testimony.  Then the taxpayer was allowed to cross examine me.\n\nHe asked me \"why the IRS disallowed his refund.\"\n\nI explained [for about the fifth time] I do not work for the IRS, and I do not know why the IRS did what they did.  He would need to ask the IRS.\n\nI was tempted to comment that if the IRS also disallowed his refund, it would appear the state-side adjustment was also correct, since we follow federal law.  I decided against it.\n\nNext he said, \"No further questions.\"\n\nGoing to trial is expensive.  Both sides had to split the costs for the court stenographer ($1,400, so $700 each).\n\nDuring the lead-up to the trial, I told him multiple times **we are not the IRS**.\n\nDude literally paid $700 to ask me under oath if I worked for the IRS; because apparently my telling him multiple times that I do not (and all of our correspondences being on my State's letterhead) was not good enough for him.  I think he may have had some brutal follow-up questions for the IRS, and he was completely blindsided by this revelation?  IDK.  The amount at issue was about $3,000; so $700 was a hefty amount for the taxpayer.\n\nOf course he lost.  We knew we were probably going to win before trial, but when he declined to even ask me any questions which could advance his case, it was clearly over.\n\nEdit: minor grammar",

I replied, \"no thanks, ma'am.\"\n\nWell that middle-aged biddy behind the counter misheard that as \"no thanks, man.\"\n\n I got treated to a full up and down tongue lashing how she was many things, but had never been mistaken for a man... Etc etc. It carried on for some time.\n\nI paid without saying another word, and left.\n\nSo if that old woman's hearing is on the way out - you might want to be careful with the usage of ma'am as well . ;)",
