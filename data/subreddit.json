                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.  That would at least be the baloney sandwich of tipping.",

                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.

When I was in high school, we once arrived home to find all of our utilities shut off. We used the neighbors phone to call the utility companies and found out the bills weren't paid. My mother gave my brother the bills to put in the mailbox. We found months of bills under my brothers mattress. He put them there and forgot about it. Then I got stuck being the responsible one all the time. A blessing in disguise",

That was reserved for emergencies; if you needed to ask a question you get off your butt and go find the person you need to talk to. \n\nNow as an adult, when I'm at other people's homes and they are yelling from various rooms at each other it feels so aggressive, haha. If I'm asking you how many hotdogs you want on the BBQ for dinner I just go find you in the basement, I don't scream, \"BRIAN!!! HOW MANY HOT DOGS DO YOU WANT?? HOT DOGS. HOW MANY. DID YOU SAY THREE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU\"",

                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.

When I was in high school, we once arrived home to find all of our utilities shut off. We used the neighbors phone to call the utility companies and found out the bills weren't paid. My mother gave my brother the bills to put in the mailbox. We found months of bills under my brothers mattress. He put them there and forgot about it. Then I got stuck being the responsible one all the time. A blessing in disguise",

That was reserved for emergencies; if you needed to ask a question you get off your butt and go find the person you need to talk to. \n\nNow as an adult, when I'm at other people's homes and they are yelling from various rooms at each other it feels so aggressive, haha. If I'm asking you how many hotdogs you want on the BBQ for dinner I just go find you in the basement, I don't scream, \"BRIAN!!! HOW MANY HOT DOGS DO YOU WANT?? HOT DOGS. HOW MANY. DID YOU SAY THREE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU\"",

                        "body": "This is one of those things that like, *you have to fucking explain* if you want people not to do it. Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.

Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.

If I'm asking you how many hotdogs you want on the BBQ for dinner I just go find you in the basement, I don't scream, \"BRIAN!!! HOW MANY HOT DOGS DO YOU WANT?? HOT DOGS. HOW MANY. DID YOU SAY THREE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU\"",

Most people don't follow rules blindly just because they were told to. They use their own judgement when deciding what rules to follow, which means they have to be able to understand why that rule exists. So if they have no idea what the reasoning behind a rule is, they're likely to assume it's a stupid/arbitrary rule that doesn't actually matter (because again, if it DID matter, then surely they would have been given a concrete reason WHY it matters).\n\n(Case in point: I recently bought a new lamp with instructions that say to *turn off the breaker for the outlet you want to plug it into*, before you plug it in. No explanation whatsoever about why that could possibly be necessary. I have literally never in my life encountered another electric device with that requirement, and I have never had issues plugging and unplugging other lamps. So, no, I'm not going to be doing that lmao, because it makes zero sense for me to assume that there could be negative consequences for not complying with that requirement.)\n\nIf you only ever scream at your kids not to use your sewing scissors, they have no idea why it matters, because they would never intuit on their own that simple paper can destroy scissors (since it doesn't align with their experience of, yknow, using scissors). So they'll go \"who cares it's just scissors\" and keep using them. If you explain that sewing scissors are extremely sharp, so sharp that even cutting literal paper will dull them so much that they can no longer cut fabric, then they now know what the issue is, and only an asshole who actively wants to destroy your belongings would keep using them. Yeah it takes more time to explain this than it does to just scream at them for breaking your rules, but if you actually care about your rules *being followed* then this is not an optional step lol.\n\n~~Sorry for the rant oops, can you tell this has been an issue with family members of mine before lmao~~",

Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.  That would at least be the baloney sandwich of tipping.",

Then tidying up her room. My kids put their dishes in the sink when they are finished as soon as they can reach - that\u2019s so they don\u2019t throw them and break something glass. We have them transport laundry to the washer. We also have them help with preparing meals whenever possible and especially when they show interest.\n\nWhen I was growing up, the rule was also \u201cwhen you can reach\u201d - when you\u2019re tall enough to press the buttons on the washing machine, that becomes your chore. When you\u2019re tall enough to lean over the sink and reach the water, you wash them/load the dishwasher. \n\nIt\u2019s always fascinating to me to see how much my kids want or know to do already just by observing us do it. They love to help sweep and have started to show interest in vacuuming. Just giving them the chance to hold things and praising them goes a long way. Then, once they show an interest in things at the store (\u201ccan I have that?\u201d, \u201ccan I have this for my birthday?\u201d), you can build in an allowance system. \n\nKudos to you for being willing to ask!!",
