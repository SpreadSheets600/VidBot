Now you've got time to..............!\"\n\n\nTo this day, I am also EXTREMELY wary of being invited to go anywhere or do anything, especially if I am not in total control (i.e. driving, paying, scheduling, navigating, and interacting in all ways with the parties at the endpoint).  \"Let's get lunch\" would always turn into a twelve or eighteen hour labour intensive journey and then \"lunch\" at the end was a baloney sandwich on cheap white bread, or a free hamburger from a coupon (if anything at all).  Any interactions with people along the way were conducted in such a rude manner that it would be mortifying to ever return, even though next \"lunch\", you very well might.  No tips, price haggling, straight cheating, condescension, bullying, insisting others go above and beyond for no reward other than \"keeping your little job, if you even value it\".  And the purchases were always.... telling.  Like, you're haggling over the price of a new net for the tennis court, or not tipping the people who just loaded and delivered twenty five tonnes of mulch and topsoil *for your own personal home landscaping*.  They know you have the money to say thank you, and therefore they know that you don't appreciate what they've done at all when they're not even given a bottle of water, much less a couple bucks.  That would at least be the baloney sandwich of tipping.",

I\u2019m sure that I didn\u2019t notice quickly, as we weren\u2019t super tight, but I know that he did it for weeks at a minimum. \n\nIt turns out that this visionary dude was trying to build a sandbox in his backyard, and he\u2019d go dump his shoe sand in the same place each day before coming inside. His mom eventually caught him filling his shoes and confronted him about it. She laughed with a mixture of embarrassment and complete delight at how funny it was, and he was so disappointed that his scheme had come to an end. The juxtaposition of their faces was pure gold. \n\nI hope that now-38-year-old guy is doing well. What a creative dude.",
