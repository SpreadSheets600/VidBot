The point being, everyone was scavenging weird shady warehouses for parts they always expected to get from tier 1 suppliers, product lines that weren't THE most profitable lines from Texas Instruments etc were canned.  Meaning a LOT of engineering was done on hardware to make the parts shortage \"invisible\" to consumers, you only heard about the chip shortages in cars mainly.  But, you were THIS close to having chip shortages for toasters, microwaves, other consumer electronics etc on a massive scale.\n\nThen everything went back to normal just-in-time B.S. and we've done not a thing to secure the supply chain again.\n\nEdit:  I forgot to mention, since the people we were dealing with were overseas scalpers, the value of me doing the shopping was that I got to buy under my tiny engineering firm's name instead of Client's globally recognized brand so that the price wasnt 20x regular (that they probably would have been forced to pay)",

All the pipe, valves, tanks, and wells are part of the project.    The developer sets up a small water company to run the system, and the board members are part of the community.\n\nThe board members run the water company on a shoe string budget because if they raise rates, they are voted out.\n\nIt\u2019s 50 years later and the system infrastructure is now on its last legs.  They have done some well maintenance over the years, but now the steel casings on the wells are starting to collapse, and the main tank is corroded badly.  The water company has no reserves to replace anything because they only ever raised rates to cover operating expenses.  The board is hoping the state or will give them grants to replace their infrastructure only to be told that they are not eligible because they still have a functioning well.\n\nSo now they have to try to go finance the improvements, but they don\u2019t have any assets other than their small customer base.  To cover the finance cost, the board is forced to raise rates, which gets half of the voted out.  This delays the improvements a couple of years until the new guys are finally convinced they are not fixing their system without a rate increase\u2026 and then rates triple.  To hear they customers whine you would have thought we killed their dogs.  No, it was all the result of poor planning.",

I don\u2019t know any teachers who still really have their whole heart in it anymore, we are all emotionally checked out, burned out beyond repair, exhausted and barely getting through. None of us are in it for the money, so if we also aren\u2019t there for the personal fulfillment anymore I don\u2019t know how long the health insurance will really keep us in the profession. \n\nMany districts are facing continuously declining enrollment. That means less money each year, so everything gets a little (or a lot) shittier. Unless there\u2019s a total overhaul of how we fund schools, this is a death spiral. School buildings are crumbling and overcrowded. \n\nThe kids are not okay. COVID broke the world and while I guess a lot of adults can overlook that it\u2019s glaringly obvious in a school setting. I don\u2019t blame kids or families\u2014 it\u2019s deeper than that. We have been collectively failed by our government and it is our kids who are suffering. They don\u2019t know how to function in a community. There\u2019s an epidemic of mistrust, expertise and reliable information have lost all credibility, and the normalization of AI has eroded any sense that learning is even worthwhile. \n\nOur public schools should be the glowing centers of our communities. We should be proud of how much we spend on education, because it should matter to us that our children are able to do incredible things. We should brag about how beautiful the new middle school is and how every kid has access to the best books and equipment in every classroom. My neighbors should be excited to pay my salary and fund my classroom projects instead of having been convinced that my union exists to steal their taxes. \n\nFree public education is the best idea anyone has ever had. There are a million systems and structures within it that I desperately want to change, but the central concept of allowing every kid in America to learn enough to be able to dream big is fucking beautiful and I\u2019m not ready to give up on it yet.

But that school, when you walked in there you could tell it meant something to the community when it was built. \n\nIt was five stories tall and it sat on the corner in the middle of a bunch of old farms. It was the high school for about half the county until a new one was built in the 70s, and they turned it into the elementary school. It was massive and it was beautiful. This was a rural farming community but this building had custom stone carvings throughout it. The floors were granite. \n\nAt the time it was built this would have been the fanciest building in the entire county. It was nicer than any of the nearby churches even. They didn\u2019t have to make it that nice but they did because at that time education was respected. It\u2019s just not like that anymore.",

They\u2019d rather shoot from the hip on an antibiotic or two and hope for the best than send out and wait a day for the result to tell them what\u2019s the most effective treatment.\n\nThis is the problem.",

A lot of moviegoers have no respect for the people around them like they used to. Add in broken down seats and overpriced concessions and going to the movies is becoming a disaster\n\nTickets and snacks is now running close to $100 for a family of 4 that I can rent for $24.95 at home within a few weeks of theatre release.\n\nMost movies now are sequels, remakes, or reboots of old movies. There are very few unique storylines in Hollywood anymore.\n\nI can get a fantastic projection tv system that goes to a 150 inch tv with a full surround sound 8 speaker system for under $5000 now. And I don't have to put up with all the crap from other rude patrons at home. Theatre style kettle popcorn maker for under $100.\n\nAnd I can pause it when I need to go pee.",

                "body": "The wind turbine industry, and possibly the entire power generation industry as a whole in a few years, possibly. \n\nHow many turbine manufacturers can you name off the top of your head? How many are in the market? Like large wind turbines, the ones that power the grid, not the little ones you have that can maybe charge your phone over 3 days. \n\nOne of those companies is Gamesa. They were bought out by the energy division of Siemens a few years back, and Siemens sold off their energy division to operate by itself a few years after that. \n\nAlright, so new company, not exactly a small company, but not exactly under big Siemens\u2019 protection anymore. \n\nSo Siemens Gamesa as they\u2019re known now tried a new design with their turbines. It worked great. It sold well. Really well. *Too* well. \n\nThere was a critical flaw in the bearing. You know, the single part that holds the spinny bit to the not spinny bit. The part that would send the blades flying across the place if it broke. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a maintenance issue. It wasn\u2019t an installation issue. It was a *design flaw.*\n\nSo there were really only two options for SE Gamesa. Recall pretty much every single turbine they\u2019ve sold, or pay to maintain and replace every single turbine they\u2019ve sold for a good chunk of their lifespan. \n\nAs you can guess, this is not exactly great for their bottom line. \n\nSiemens Energy makes around $2 billion in profit each quarter. SE Gamesa loses around $1 billion dollars in profit each quarter, and that number\u2019s only been growing due to other issues discovered. \n\nThere\u2019s really only 4 manufacturers of large gas turbines around the world. LGT\u2019s are vital for the grid because of *ramp rates,* because we don\u2019t exactly have a great way to store excess electricity right now. \n\nTo put it in a really simplified way, your power production must perfectly match power demand, otherwise the *frequency* of your AC output goes out of sync. Too much power, and AC frequency goes too high. Too little power, and the frequency drops too low. \n\nAll it takes to fry most electrics is 1hz out of tune. Everything would fizzle, pop, and possibly explode. Your phone charger and laptop, though they can be replaced. How about, oh, I don\u2019t know, every single traffic light, hospital computer, radio towers and quite literally everything plugged into AC power?\n\nSo like, yeah, you have to match production with demand. \n\nThis is why solar, wind, and other renewables are not able to fully replace fossil fuel and hydro power. They are unpredictable, and the fast ramping fossil fuels can pick up the slack when, say, a cloud moves in, or the winds slow down. \n\nNatural gas turbines are generally considered the cleanest and most effective of the fast ramping power plants - coal is cheaper but more dirty, nuclear is much cleaner but super expensive and political (\u201chi, we\u2019re building a nuclear power plant next door\u201d), and hydroelectric dams are amazing but you can\u2019t exactly dam up a river that people have built a city on. This is why almost every local and state level government have been replacing coal plants with natural gas plants. \n\nSo, if the Siemens Gamesa fiasco gets any worse, Siemens Energy as a whole could go under. Demand for gas turbines have also been skyrocketing due to data centers and AI, so they\u2019re filling their order books with orders that they cannot deliver as to not lose market share. Eventually it would reach a breaking point - would you stick around in a line for a movie if the queue was 3 weeks, even if you\u2019ve paid a $5 deposit? \n\nOf course, the reasonable response for any company with *too much demand they cannot keep up with* is to expand. Er, problem. \n\nIt takes money to expand. Gamesa\u2019s eating all of that up. \n\nSo they\u2019re bleeding cash, writing checks they cannot cash, but at least they\u2019ve got demand and could expand slowly over time?\n\nTPG is a private equity firm. I do not need to tell you how bad PE is for a struggling corporation. They saw the Gamesa situation and stepped in and bought a bunch of shares in it. \n\nWhat did they do to make things better?\n\nGamesa released a press release saying how they are divesting in the Indian market. What they actually said was that TPG forced Gamesa to transfer its orders to other companies that TPG owned. In short, TPG cannibalized Gamesa\u2019s order book in one of the fastest growing markets. And remember, Gamesa had their best quarter since like 2020, and they\u2019ve still lost a billion dollars this quarter. \n\nSo imagine you have a hot dog stand. You randomly decided to buy a lemonade stand one day - and it\u2019s eating half of your profits. Profits you would have spent expanding production of your hot dogs, which are selling out like crazy. You spend money from hot dogs you didn\u2019t even deliver yet to expand your market - all while a private equity firm is directing your customers to a different company\u2019s hot dogs stand. The very private equity firm that now owns a good chunk of your own hot dog stand. And is eyeing up buying another big chunk. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that there would only be 3 companies to buy large gas turbines from, but your local politicians might find it hard to buy a natural gas power plant for cheap if Siemens Energy goes under. Especially since those 3 manufacturers kind of have a defined \u201chome turf\u201d to sell to.",

Camera systems were also hardwired and recorded locally.\n\nThen people stopped having home phones and burglars would sometimes cut telephone lines before breaking in. So everything went cellular for communication.\n\nOver the years big companies like ADT didn't want to pay for trained and experienced installers and service technicians, so they started installing wireless sensors. Because it takes almost no training or experience to install or repair a system like this. Just plug and play, super quick installations, no wiring to worry about, hardly any liability related to accidents in installations, no drilling or going into attics or crawl spaces. Way more cost effective for them, especially since ADT also owned the manufacturering companies that made the products.\n\nThen people started install wifi cloud based cameras like ring and arlo. That ceased to function if they lost connectivity. Versus hardwired cameras with local DVRs.\n\nEverything got easier and faster and streamlined.\n\nOnly problem is that what this means is the entirety of someone's security is contingent on open air communication of wireless signals.\n\nNow you can go online and buy cheap jammers that will kill: Wifi, 4gLte, and wireless alarm sensors.\n\nBefore you would have to cut phonelines and disable sirens, and take dvrs with you to circumvent a person's security system.\n\nNow in the majority of homes you can just turn on a high powered portable jammer and walk right in. The alarm wont trigger, because the alarm panel can receive signals from the sensors because of the interference. Even if it does, it cant call the police because the cellular signals it sends are being blocked. And wifi cameras wont even leave you with any usable footage.\n\nWorst yet, alot of small buisness are set up this same way. Not all, alot still do hardwired. But every day more and more are being upgraded to wireless equipment, less hardwired systems are being installed.",
